	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			I first began athletics in school competing in the school competitions that took place at the end of the school year.I often placed very well in these competitions and it is a very a crucuial reason why I decided to take up the sport.My PE teacher was very supportive of me and highly encouraged me to continue athletics into my adolescence which was highly motivating.</p>

			<p>I started out at my local club at the age of 11 and enjoyed it thoroughly.I had the opportunity to meet new people however I had a passion for football at the time and that was my main priority.In 2017,after a few years of playing football, I decided to return to athletics as I felt it was where my talents were at and I have been doing it ever since.</p>

		<h2>Role Models</h2>
		<p>
			There are many people that I look up to in athletics aswell as other sports.Some of the following include:
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Usain Bolt</li>
			<li>Asafa Powell</li>
			<li>Wayde Van Niekerk</li>
			<li>Roger Federer</li>
			<li>Lionel Messi</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			My favourite athlete is Usain Bolt mainly due to the charisma he possesses on and off the track and his unparalleled feats he has achieved during his career.
